Band Reservation System - C# Console Application
## Overview

This project is a C# console application developed as a school partial exam. It simulates a simple band reservation system, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts such as static attributes, methods, and collections.

## Features

  Reservation Management

    Register reservations (CReserva) with date, duration, band name, and reservation number.
    
    Calculate total amount for each reservation.
    
    Identify the reservation with the highest total amount.

  Pricing

    Static hourly rate (costo_por_hora) applied to all reservations.
    
    Discounts applied for long-duration reservations (6 hours or more).
    
    Conversion to Euros using a user-specified exchange rate.

  Inheritance & Static Members

    Demonstrates static attributes and methods to manage global pricing rules.

## Project Structure

  Entities:

    CReserva (reservation class)

  Execution:

    CEjecutora (main program to interact with the user via console)

## Usage

  Clone the repository.
  
  Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the C# extension.
  
  Build and run the application.
  
  Follow the console prompts to register reservations, calculate totals, and identify the reservation with the highest total.

## Notes

This project demonstrates OOP principles in C#, including static attributes, methods, and encapsulation.

Some parts are designed for exam purposes and may not be fully complete.
